# Reverse_Engineering

## Description
AS A developer
I WANT a walk-through of the codebase
SO THAT I can use it as a starting point for a new project

## Usage
When joining a new team, you will be expected to inspect a lot of code that you have never seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line for you, you will dissect the code by yourself, saving any questions for a member of your team.
